# EEGraph

EEGraph is a Python library to model electroencephalograms (EEGs) as graphs, so the connectivity between different brain areas could be analyzed. It has applications
in the study of neurologic diseases like Parkinson or epilepsy. The graph can be exported as a NetworkX graph-like object and it can also be visualized.
